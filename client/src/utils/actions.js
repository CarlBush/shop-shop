//Actions: These define the types of events that can be emitted to update state. State can only be updated if it's a predefined action.

//UPDATE_PRODUCTS is used by the ProductList component
export const UPDATE_PRODUCTS = "UPDATE_PRODUCTS";

//UPDATE_CATEGORIES works a lot like UPDATE_PRODUCTS in that we want to take the list of categories retrieved from the server by Apollo and store it in this global state.
export const UPDATE_CATEGORIES = "UPDATE_CATEGORIES";

//UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY is sort of the connecting piece of data for the previous two actions we created.
export const UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY = "UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY";
